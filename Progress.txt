B_AT - gets interrupted by central uC


C_uno - sends serial data
C_node - reads serial port and send to computer. Can use two // serial ports

D_AT - prints "uint8"+"e"
D_node - reads serial port till "e" and send to computer with inverted sawtooth

E - Testing serial buffer of nodeMCU
E_UNO - sends serial data to an ideling MCU and trigger it using pin 13
E_node - wait till uno triggers it and read the serial buffer. max size = 257 bytes

F_node - making the data buffer to send to server
F_AT - sending serial data periodically

G_node - sending data from NodeMCU and ATTiny to mongoDB
